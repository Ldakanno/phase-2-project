# AloePro

AloePro is an informative plant web application inspired specifically by aloe plants. Users will find information about the plants and they will also see images of those plants. Users can also leave comments on the website. 

This project was created to practice making fetch requests and display the core concepts of React that I am learning in my studies. 

## Technologies Used
### The following was used to make this web application: 

- React

- JSON server


## Features
### What is expected: 

- Users will be able to search an aloe plant and receive relevant information if that plant is in the database.

- Users will see a display of a plant upon first visiting the site. 

- Users will be able to navigate to information provided on the plants. 


## Requirements

This project is made using JSON server. To interact with full functionality, this repository can be forked. JSON Server needs to be installed and running.
